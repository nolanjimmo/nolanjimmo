## About Me
I am a recent graduate of the University of Vermont with both a Bachelor of Science and Masters degree in Computer Science, where I was enrolled in the universities Accelerated Masters program. I am currently looking a full-time job, please feel free to look around a couple of my repo's and see what I have worked on throughout my undergraduate and graduate career!

## Currently In-Progress
I am currently working on creating my own handicap calculator (golf) that I will eventually be hosting through AWS EC2. This began a command-line program that I just used for myself to calculate my handicap as a golfer, but I have expanded it in to a full site, database-connected back end, etc. so that myself and my buddies can use it together, share information about our golf games, etc. Navigate to my repo's page and it should be the first one if you are interested in checking it out! I will post the link when I get it successfully hosted with AWS.

## Highlights
There have been a number of projects that I have had the privelege of working on, below are links to a few that have been especially meaningful to me:

[Multiple Sclerosis Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/nolanjimmo/ML-MS-Prediction-Project)<br>
My team and I worked with one of the Graduate Research Labs at UVM on writing classifiers for predicting falling risk level in Multiple Sclerosis patients. The goal of the lab was to build an app that could give real-time feedback to MS patients on their fall risk levels based on wearable sensor data captured at any time by each patient at home. For our project we demonstrated how this classification worked and were able to accurately determine a patients risk level, indicating what they would be able to physically tolerate during the day. The algorithm(s) were then passed on to the lab where they are in development in the user app (mobile).

[Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/nolanjimmo/Rock-Paper-Scissors-With-Graphcis)<br>
[NBA Trading Card Service](https://github.com/nolanjimmo/NBA-Trading-Cards)<br>
Linked above are two graphics-heavy projects that I worked on with two different teams of people. Rock paper scissors, written in C++ is a simple implementation of the well-known game, with all graphics and controls built by my partner and I using OpenGL and standard C++ libraries.<br>
The NBA trading card service is a Python-based trading card webservice that we built both the backend database and API for (Python and MySQL), as well as the front-end webapp (Python and Flask).

[American Sign Language Learning Aid](https://github.com/nolanjimmo/ASL-Learning-Aid/blob/master/leapDrawCircle.js)<br>
This was an individual project I wrote in Python and Javascript that is an interactive Sign Language learning aid. Using a Leap Motion Sensor, the user is able to interact with the aid when given an example sign to try, and the program gives feedback on the correctness of the users physical signing. Included is a crude account (sign in/out) system, a training mode and a testing mode, that keeps track of a users score and time to be able to compare with their previous scores as well as other users scores.
